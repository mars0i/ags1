Anything that you want figwheel to hot-load has to be under resources/public.
e.g. if you want to use agentscript, and it's not available from cljsjs, you
need to put the agentscript libs under resources/public.

To access the agentscript ABM object, you need this:

(this-as this
  ...
  (.-ABM this)
  ...)
